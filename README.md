Flight computer for rocket competition. 

This flight computer is designed for high-performance rocketry competitions, offering precise measurement and control for various flight parameters. The system integrates a range of sensors and features to ensure reliable data acquisition and communication throughout the flight. It is built with flexibility, durability, and scalability in mind for a variety of mission profiles.

Key Features:

-  Accelerometers: Dual-range accelerometers (+/-16g and +/-200g) for accurate low and high-g-force measurement during flight.
-  Pressure Sensor: Atmospheric pressure monitoring for altitude and environmental data.
-  Humidity & Temperature Sensor: Measures environmental conditions critical for flight analysis.
-  Magnetometer: Provides orientation and heading information by sensing the Earthâ€™s magnetic field.
-  Current Sensor: Tracks power consumption for optimized energy management.
-  Camera Interface (FPC): Supports OV5640 camera for video and image capture during flight.
-  WiFi & Bluetooth: Wireless communication for data transfer and real-time telemetry.
-  GNSS (Global Navigation Satellite System): Provides accurate positioning data for tracking and flight path monitoring.
-  LoRa: Long-range, low-power communication capability for telemetry.
-  Pyro Channel: Single pyro channel for controlled deployment of parachutes or other pyrotechnic devices.
-  Motor Control: Supports either one dual-coil stepper motor or up to four servomotors, operating between 5V and 12V for mechanical actuation.
-  Passive Buzzer: Provides audio alerts for critical status or events.
-  LED Indicators: Visual feedback for power, status, and activity.
-  Memory: Includes both flash storage and microSD for data logging and flight data retention.
